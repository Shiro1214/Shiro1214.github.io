# Portfolio Website

## Introduction
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website showcases my professional profile, skills, experiences, and projects. It's designed to be interactive and visually appealing, utilizing Jekyll for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding dynamic effects such as smooth scrolling and section highlights.

## Features
- **Jekyll Integration**: Utilizes Jekyll to enable writing HTML content in Markdown, also for a default layout for different pages for easier management and updates, But I ended using only 1 page.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS styling ensures the website is accessible and aesthetically pleasing on all devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript is used for dynamic effects like scrolling animations, hiding and revealing sections, and highlighting the current navigation item based on the section in view.
- **Comprehensive Sections**:
  - **Profile**: A brief introduction about myself.
  - **Skills**: A detailed list of my technical and soft skills.
  - **Experiences**: An overview of my professional background.
  - **Projects**: Highlights of various projects I've worked on or contributed to.
